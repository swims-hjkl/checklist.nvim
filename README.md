# Todolist.nvim

This is a neovim plugin, to manage your todos.

When you are working on a project and want to note something and come back to it later, you can add a checklist item. This will be stored and available for viewing/modification later.

After adding checklist items, there are 3 ways to retrieve them.
1. Retrieve all checklist items. 
2. Retrieve checklist items corresponding to a project (works based off of your current working directory at the time of adding the item)
3. Retrieve checklist items  corresponding to a file (works based off of current file open at the time of adding the item)
